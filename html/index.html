        <p><em>Founder and CEO of <strong><a href="#">ZeroDay Security.</a></strong></em></p>
        <br> 
        <p>I am an idea, a thought. There is no John HapponBoni, as well as there is no ZeroDay Security. It is a kind of an abstraction, part of the mind of a guy who wrote this code and did not want to share his personal information for now, althought, clearly, I can represent his goal in working with cybersecurity and help with the betterment of the world This is my telling, and my paragraph in which is the only place where I assert that I presumably exist, but it is not the case, there is no John.</p>
